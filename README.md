# IoTCheck DPOR
This is the repository that contains the DPOR implementation for IoTCheck. Please read the [IoTCheck paper](https://2020.esec-fse.org/details/fse-2020-papers/16/Understanding-and-Automatically-Detecting-Conflicting-Interactions-between-Smart-Home) and [Github/Wiki](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck) and our IoTCheck DPOR implementation paper before using this repository.

## Getting Started
Our DPOR implementation runs on IoTCheck. Thus, this repository contains the files that are necessary to enable DPOR when running IoTCheck. First, please [install IoTCheck as per these instructions](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck/blob/master/README.md#getting-started). We can use the [Vagrant-packaged IoTCheck](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck-vagrant) to handle all the required applications that enable IoTCheck or any Linux-based system/VM. IoTCheck was developed on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus).

To understand the background, design, and implementation of IoTCheck, please read the [IoTCheck paper](https://2020.esec-fse.org/details/fse-2020-papers/16/Understanding-and-Automatically-Detecting-Conflicting-Interactions-between-Smart-Home) and the [IoTCheck paper](https://2020.esec-fse.org/details/fse-2020-papers/16/Understanding-and-Automatically-Detecting-Conflicting-Interactions-between-Smart-Home). 
To see IoTCheck in action, please [run the examples provided on the IoTCheck Github](https://github.com/uci-plrg/iotcheck/blob/master/README.md#examples) to make sure that your IoTCheck installation is good.
